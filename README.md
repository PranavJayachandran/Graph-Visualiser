# Graph Visualiser

A Website to visualize the graph you want and at the same time do some basic graph operations like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra Algorithm, and Minimum Spanning Algorithm

## Disclamer
The Visualiser at present is created for nodes with ids only 0 to 99. I would recommend you use numbers in that range to represent the nodes.

## Dijkstra Algorithm 
It is the shortest path-finding algorithm that I implemented here using Java Script. The color of the path with minimum distance is calculated and represented in a different color.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
MST here is found using Prim's Algorithm. It is a basic well know algorithm used to find the MST, the color of the nodes and edges are changed to represent the MST.

Do Suggest changes if you find and would like to recommend some suggest
