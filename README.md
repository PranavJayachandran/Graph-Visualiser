# Graph Visualiser

A Website to visualise the graph you want and at the same time do some basic graph operations like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra Algorithm and Minnimum Spanning Algorithm

## Disclamer
The Visulaiser at present is create for nodes with ids only 0 to 99. I would recommend you use numbers in that range to represent the nodes.

## Dijkstra Algorithm 
It is a shortest path finding algorithm that I implemented here using Java Script. The color of the path with minimum distance is calculated and represent in a different colour.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
MST here is found using hte Prim's Algorithm. Its a basic well know algorithm used to find the MST, the color of the nodes and edges are changed to represent the MST.

Do Suggest changes if you find and would like to recommend some suggestions
